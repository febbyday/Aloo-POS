# Module Boundary Definitions

This document defines the boundaries and responsibilities between related modules to avoid duplication and conflicts.

## Products and Inventory Module Boundaries

### Products Module Responsibilities

The Products module is responsible for:

1. **Product Information Management**
   - Product CRUD operations
   - Product metadata (name, description, images, etc.)
   - Product categorization
   - Product variants and options
   - Product pricing and discounts
   - Product SEO information

2. **Product Catalog Management**
   - Product search and filtering
   - Product listing and pagination
   - Featured products management
   - Related products management
   - Product collection management

3. **Product UI Components**
   - Product cards and listings
   - Product detail pages
   - Product image galleries
   - Product option selectors
   - Product pricing displays

### Inventory Module Responsibilities

The Inventory module is responsible for:

1. **Inventory Management**
   - Stock levels tracking
   - Stock adjustment operations
   - Low stock alerts
   - Reorder point management
   - Inventory valuation
   - Inventory history tracking

2. **Warehouse Management**
   - Location management
   - Stock transfer between locations
   - Receiving inventory
   - Stock takes and adjustments
   - Warehouse picking and packing

3. **Supplier Management**
   - Supplier information
   - Purchase orders
   - Supplier performance metrics
   - Supplier communication

### Interface Between Products and Inventory

The interface between these modules is defined as follows:

1. **Shared Data Models**
   - Product ID is the primary key linking inventory to products
   - Inventory module should never modify product information
   - Products module should never directly modify inventory levels

2. **Service Interface**
   - Inventory module provides a `InventoryService` with methods like:
     - `getStockLevel(productId: string): Promise<number>`
     - `adjustStock(productId: string, quantity: number, reason: string): Promise<StockAdjustment>`
     - `isInStock(productId: string): Promise<boolean>`
     - `getLowStockProducts(): Promise<Product[]>`

3. **Events**
   - Inventory module emits events like:
     - `INVENTORY_CHANGED`
     - `LOW_STOCK_ALERT`
     - `OUT_OF_STOCK`
   - Products module listens for these events to update UI

4. **UI Integration**
   - Product detail pages include inventory widgets
   - Inventory pages include product widgets
   - Both use consistent UI patterns

### Technical Implementation

1. **Directory Structure**
   - `/src/features/products/` - All product-related code
   - `/src/features/inventory/` - All inventory-related code
   - `/src/types/common.ts` - Shared interfaces used by both modules

2. **Data Flow**
   - Products → Inventory: Product ID
   - Inventory → Products: Stock levels, Status

3. **Testing Boundaries**
   - Each module should have isolated tests
   - Integration tests should verify proper module communication

## Orders and Purchase Orders Module Boundaries

### Orders Module Responsibilities

The Orders module is responsible for:

1. **Sales Order Management**
   - Order creation and processing
   - Order status management
   - Order history
   - Invoicing
   - Shipping and delivery management
   - Returns and refunds

2. **Customer-facing Order Features**
   - Shopping cart
   - Checkout process
   - Order tracking
   - Order confirmation
   - Customer communication

### Purchase Orders Module Responsibilities

The Purchase Orders module is responsible for:

1. **Purchase Order Management**
   - PO creation and approval
   - Supplier selection
   - Receiving against POs
   - PO status tracking
   - Payment tracking
   - PO communications

2. **Procurement Planning**
   - Demand forecasting
   - Reorder suggestions
   - Vendor selection
   - Cost analysis

### Interface Between Orders and Purchase Orders

1. **Shared Data Models**
   - Product ID as the common reference
   - Different order structures (sales vs. purchase)

2. **Service Interface**
   - Clearly defined service methods
   - No direct database access across modules

3. **Events**
   - Event-based communication for cross-module concerns

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing features that span multiple modules:

1. **Use Service Boundaries**
   - Create service interfaces between modules
   - Document the contract clearly
   - Version the interfaces

2. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - Use events for loose coupling
   - Document event payloads
   - Include event versioning

3. **Shared Type Definitions**
   - Define shared types in a common location
   - Version shared types
   - Keep shared types minimal

4. **UI Component Boundaries**
   - Create clear UI component interfaces
   - Document required props
   - Handle loading and error states consistently

5. **Documentation**
   - Document integration points
   - Provide examples of proper cross-module usage
   - Document data flow across boundaries
