  - Sorting and filtering
  - Custom row styling based on market status
  - Action buttons for view details, edit, manage stock, and delete operations
  - Progress bars for stock allocation and staff assignment

### 2. Suppliers Table

- Implemented all core functionality including:
  - Supplier name, code, email, phone, products, status, type, and rating columns
  - Row selection for bulk operations
  - Sorting and filtering
  - Custom row styling based on supplier status
  - Action buttons for view, edit, history, orders, and delete operations
  - Status badges with appropriate colors

### 3. Staff Table

### 4. Settings Tables
- Created `EnhancedPaymentMethodsTable.tsx` in `src/features/settings/components/`
  - Payment method name, status, and toggle columns
  - Toggle switch for enabling/disabling payment methods
  - System-defined badge for system payment methods
  - Action buttons for settings, edit, and delete operations
  - Conditional delete action based on system-defined status

- Created `EnhancedInstallmentPlansTable.tsx` in `src/features/settings/components/`
  - Period, price range, and installments columns
  - Action buttons for settings, edit, and delete operations

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All tables now share the same look and feel, with consistent behavior for sorting, filtering, pagination, and row selection.

2. **Improved User Experience**: Enhanced tables provide better visual feedback, clearer status indicators, and more intuitive interactions.

3. **Reduced Code Duplication**: By using the standardized component, we've eliminated redundant code for common table functionality.

4. **Better Maintainability**: Future changes to table behavior can be made in one place rather than across multiple implementations.

5. **Enhanced Features**: All tables now support features that were previously inconsistent or missing:
   - Column visibility toggle
   - Consistent pagination
   - Standardized search
   - Accessible keyboard navigation
   - Responsive design

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, the next steps are:

1. **Phase 4**: Cleanup and Optimization:
   - Remove deprecated table components
   - Optimize performance of the standardized table
   - Address any issues discovered during migration
   - Update documentation based on feedback

2. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the migrated tables to ensure they function correctly in all scenarios.

3. **Documentation**: Update any remaining documentation to reflect the new table implementations.

4. **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback from users on the new table implementations to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

Phase 3 of the table migration has successfully standardized the tables in secondary features of the application. This represents the completion of the main migration effort, with only cleanup and optimization remaining in Phase 4.
