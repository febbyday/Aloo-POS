## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All tables now share the same look and feel, with consistent behavior for sorting, filtering, pagination, and row selection.

2. **Improved User Experience**: Enhanced tables provide better visual feedback, clearer status indicators, and more intuitive interactions.

3. **Reduced Code Duplication**: By using the standardized component, we've eliminated redundant code for common table functionality.

4. **Better Maintainability**: Future changes to table behavior can be made in one place rather than across multiple implementations.

5. **Enhanced Features**: All tables now support features that were previously inconsistent or missing:
   - Column visibility toggle
   - Consistent pagination
   - Standardized search
   - Accessible keyboard navigation
   - Responsive design

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the next steps are:

1. **Phase 3**: Migrate tables in secondary features:
   - Markets table
   - Suppliers table
   - Staff table
   - Settings tables

2. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the migrated tables to ensure they function correctly in all scenarios.

3. **Documentation**: Update any remaining documentation to reflect the new table implementations.

4. **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback from users on the new table implementations to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

Phase 2 of the table migration has successfully standardized the most visible and frequently used tables in the application. This represents a significant step toward a more consistent, maintainable, and user-friendly interface.
