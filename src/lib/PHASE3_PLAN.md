- [ ] Create response and request examples
- [ ] Document error codes and handling
- [ ] Add interactive API exploration tools

#### 3.3. Component Documentation
- [ ] Document all UI components created in Phase 2
- [ ] Create usage examples and live demos
- [ ] Add props documentation with TypeScript type information
- [ ] Implement component playground

#### 3.4. Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Document application architecture
- [ ] Create diagrams for state flow and component interactions
- [ ] Document design decisions and patterns
- [ ] Create onboarding documentation for new developers

#### 3.5. Usage Guides

## Integration with Previous Phases

This phase builds upon the foundations established in Phases 1 and 2:

- The testing framework will validate components created in Phase 2
- Build optimizations will improve performance of the application
- Documentation will cover the state management, form system, and component system from Phase 2
