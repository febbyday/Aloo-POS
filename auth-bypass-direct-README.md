# Authentication Bypass - Direct Method

This is a direct method to completely disable authentication checks in the POS application. Unlike the previous tools that tried to set up authentication data in localStorage, this approach directly modifies the application code to bypass all authentication checks.

## How It Works

This solution works by:

1. Creating a modified version of the `ProtectedRoute` component that always allows access
2. Replacing the original import in `App.tsx` to use our modified component instead

This approach is more reliable because it completely bypasses the authentication logic at its source, rather than trying to simulate a logged-in user.

## Files Included

1. `src/features/auth/components/BypassProtectedRoute.tsx` - The modified ProtectedRoute component that always allows access
2. `toggle-auth-bypass.bat` - A script to easily toggle the authentication bypass on and off

## How to Use

### Option 1: Using the Toggle Script

1. Run `toggle-auth-bypass.bat` from the command line
2. Follow the prompts to enable or disable the authentication bypass
3. Restart your development server to apply the changes

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Make sure the `BypassProtectedRoute.tsx` file is in the correct location
2. In `App.tsx`, change the import from:
   ```typescript
   import { ProtectedRoute } from './features/auth/components/ProtectedRoute';
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   import { ProtectedRoute } from './features/auth/components/BypassProtectedRoute';
   ```
3. Restart your development server to apply the changes

## Reverting Changes

To revert back to normal authentication:

1. Run the toggle script and choose to disable the bypass, or
2. Manually change the import in `App.tsx` back to the original ProtectedRoute component

## Security Notice

This authentication bypass is for development and testing purposes only. It should never be used in production environments or committed to your repository.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure the `BypassProtectedRoute.tsx` file is in the correct location
2. Check that the import in `App.tsx` is correctly pointing to the bypass component
3. Restart your development server after making changes
4. Check the browser console for any errors
