## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **State Management**: Using React Context API with custom hooks for state management instead of Redux to reduce boilerplate and simplify the codebase.

2. **Feature Modules**: Organizing code by feature rather than technical layers to improve cohesion and make the codebase more maintainable.

3. **Backend Integration**: Using REST API with custom service abstractions to decouple frontend from backend implementation details.

4. **UI Component Library**: Building on Radix UI primitives with a custom design system to ensure accessibility and consistent UX.

5. **Form Implementation**: Using React Hook Form with Zod validation to handle complex form requirements efficiently.

6. **Module Integration**: Using event bus pattern for cross-module communication rather than tightly coupling modules.

7. **Workflow Management**: Implementing state machines for complex workflows like repair services to ensure valid state transitions.

8. **External Service Integration**: Using adapter pattern for marketplace integrations to support multiple platforms with consistent interface.

9. **Data Migration Strategy**: Implementing a pipeline-based transformation system for importing data from third-party systems rather than direct database imports.

10. **Offline Capability Model**: Adopting a progressive enhancement approach with prioritized offline features rather than full offline application support.

11. **Help System Approach**: Building an integrated contextual help system rather than external documentation to provide just-in-time assistance.

12. **Testing Priority**: Focusing on integration and E2E tests for critical business flows rather than aiming for 100% unit test coverage.

### Technical Decisions
1. **Performance Strategy**: Implementing virtualization for large data sets and code splitting for route-based components to optimize performance.

2. **Testing Approach**: Using React Testing Library for component testing, focusing on user interactions rather than implementation details.

3. **PDF Generation**: Using a combination of @react-pdf/renderer and jsPDF to handle different report generation needs.

4. **Data Fetching**: Custom hooks with loading/error/data patterns for consistent API integration.

5. **Error Handling**: Implementing error boundaries at the feature level with standardized error UI components.

6. **Barcode/QR Generation**: Using specialized libraries for label generation in products and repair services.

7. **API Caching**: Implementing custom caching layer for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

8. **Import/Export Format Support**: Supporting CSV, Excel, and JSON formats for data exchange with standardized templates.

9. **Offline Storage**: Using IndexedDB for offline data storage with a custom sync queuing system.

10. **Testing Framework**: Adopting Vitest with React Testing Library for most tests, with a custom E2E framework for critical paths.

11. **Help Content Storage**: Using a combination of static and dynamic content with feature flags to support versioned help documentation.

## Current Challenges
