## Best Practices for Role Assignment

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign only the permissions necessary for each role to perform its functions.
2. **Separation of Duties**: Ensure critical functions require multiple roles (e.g., Finance Manager can approve refunds that Cashiers cannot process alone).
3. **Role Consolidation**: Avoid creating too many specialized roles; consolidate where appropriate.
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review role permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.
5. **Custom Roles**: Use these predefined roles as templates and customize as needed for your specific business requirements.

## Customizing Roles

While these predefined roles cover most common retail operations, you can customize roles by:

1. Navigating to Staff > Roles
2. Clicking "Add Role" to create a new role or selecting an existing role
3. Clicking "Edit Permissions" to access the permissions interface
4. Using the tabbed interface to configure permissions by module
5. Saving changes to apply the new permission settings

This granular permissions system ensures that each staff member has exactly the access they need—no more, no less—to perform their job efficiently while maintaining system security.
