# Staff Tables and Reports Real API Integration

This document details how we've replaced mock data in the staff tables and reports with real API data.

## Overview

The staff management and reporting features now use real backend API data instead of hardcoded mock data. This enhances the application by:

1. Providing a single source of truth for data
2. Ensuring data consistency across different views
3. Enabling real data persistence and state management
4. Improving the overall user experience

## Components Updated

### 1. Staff Page and Table

The main staff table has been updated to use data from the API:

- The `StaffPage.tsx` component fetches staff data using the `staffService.fetchAll()` method
- The `StaffTable.tsx` component now receives this API data via props
- Loading states indicate when data is being fetched
- Error handling provides feedback when API calls fail

### 2. Staff Details Page

The staff details view has been updated to fetch individual staff records from the API:

- Uses `staffService.fetchById(staffId)` to get specific staff details
- Displays loading states during API calls
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Updates and deletes are handled through API calls

### 3. Staff Reports

Staff reports now use real staff data from the API with the following enhancements:

- Created a new `useStaffReports` hook that:
  - Fetches staff data from the API
  - Transforms it into report-friendly formats
  - Handles loading and error states
- The `StaffReportsPage` component now uses this hook instead of hardcoded mock data
- Added proper loading indicators during data fetching
- Implemented empty state handling when no staff data is available

## Implementation Details

### API Service

The integration uses the `staffService.ts` service which provides:

```typescript
export const staffService = {
  fetchAll: async (): Promise<Staff[]> => { /* ... */ },
  fetchById: async (id: string): Promise<Staff | null> => { /* ... */ },
  create: async (data: Partial<Staff>): Promise<Staff> => { /* ... */ },
  update: async (id: string, data: Partial<Staff>): Promise<Staff> => { /* ... */ },
  delete: async (id: string): Promise<boolean> => { /* ... */ }
};
```

### Hook-Based Data Fetching

We've implemented custom hooks for data fetching:

1. **useStaff Hook**:
   - Provides state management for staff data
   - Handles pagination and filtering
   - Exposes loading and error states

2. **useStaffReports Hook**:
   - Fetches staff data and transforms it for reporting
   - Provides methods for refreshing report data
   - Handles loading states and error feedback

### Mock Backend Integration

The application now fetches data from a mock Express.js backend that:
- Provides realistic API endpoints
- Handles CRUD operations
- Persists data during the session
- Simulates network delays and errors

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start both the frontend and backend servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Verify that the staff table loads data from the API by:
   - Adding new staff members and confirming they appear in the table
   - Editing staff members and confirming the changes appear
   - Deleting staff members and confirming they're removed

3. Test the staff reports by:
   - Ensuring reports reflect the actual staff data
   - Testing the refresh functionality
   - Verifying that report data updates when staff data changes

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: 
   - Single source of truth for data
   - Cleaner component code without hardcoded mock data

2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Consistent data across different views
   - Proper loading states
   - Informative error messages

3. **Easier Testing**:
   - Components can be tested with mocked API responses
   - Behavior is more predictable

4. **Future-Proofing**:
   - Ready for integration with a real backend
   - Follows standard API patterns
