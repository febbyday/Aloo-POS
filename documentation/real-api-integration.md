# Staff API Integration

This document explains how the staff management features have been updated to use real API data instead of mock data.

## Overview

All staff-related pages, forms, and components now communicate with the backend API instead of using hardcoded mock data. This provides a more realistic user experience and allows for actual data persistence.

## Updated Components

### 1. StaffPage.tsx

- Now fetches staff data from the backend API on component mount
- Implements proper loading states and error handling
- Connects create, update, and delete operations to the API
- Provides toast notifications for success and error states

### 2. StaffDetailsPage.tsx

- Fetches specific staff details by ID from the API
- Handles loading and error states
- Updates staff details through API calls
- Processes staff deletion via API

### 3. StaffModal.tsx

- Properly handles form submission
- Connects to the backend for data operations
- Provides form reset functionality for better UX

## API Service

The integration uses the `staffService.ts` service which provides the following methods:

- `fetchAll()`: Get all staff members
- `fetchById(id)`: Get a specific staff member by ID
- `create(data)`: Create a new staff member
- `update(id, data)`: Update an existing staff member
- `delete(id)`: Delete a staff member

## Mock Backend

The backend implementation uses Express.js to provide a simulated API with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/staff`: Get all staff
- `GET /api/v1/staff/:id`: Get staff by ID
- `POST /api/v1/staff`: Create new staff
- `PATCH /api/v1/staff/:id`: Update staff
- `DELETE /api/v1/staff/:id`: Delete staff

Data is stored in-memory during the session but persisted until the server restarts.

## Testing the Integration

To test the integration:

1. Start both the frontend and backend servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Staff Management page
3. Try performing CRUD operations:
   - Create new staff members with banking details
   - View staff details
   - Edit staff information
   - Delete staff

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the API integration:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the backend server is running on port 5000
3. Ensure API endpoints are accessible by testing directly with tools like Postman
4. Review network requests in the browser's developer tools

## Future Improvements

- Implement pagination for large staff datasets
- Add filtering options on the backend
- Implement proper authentication for API access
- Add better error handling and recovery mechanisms
